<!-- By using parallel="methods" (threads=@test methods) we can improve performance -->
<!-- By default thread-count is equal to number of @test annotations -->
<!-- we can also run methods and classes in parallel by default thread-count is 5 -->
<!-- parallel and thread-count is used for normal test cases but for data 
	provider method we need to add parallel=true in the data provider annotation 
	and data-provider-thread-count to mention no of thread by default it is 10 -->
